* [**Architecrure of CNN**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/architecture-of-convolutional-neural-networks-simplified-demystified/) A wonderful article to introduce the architecure of a CNN.

### not read yet, but should be good material.
* [10 dl architecures must know](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/10-advanced-deep-learning-architectures-data-scientists/) - Introduce "Alex net", "VGG net", "Google Net" etc.



## Gradient Decent
* [Model Optimization](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/model_optimization.html) - good material about gradient decent.
